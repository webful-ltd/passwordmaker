      # Adding xvfb was the easiest way to get simulated non-headless tests working, and we
      # had thorny compat issues trying to use WebDriver.io + Puppeteer. If build times are
      # ever an issue we can start building a custom Docker image that already has xvfb baked
      # in, so we don't have to wait for this install on each run.
