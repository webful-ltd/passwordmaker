# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version            | Supported          |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 2.3.x (e.g. 2.3.0) | :white_check_mark: |

Due to app stores' distribution mechanisms, the frameworks the app depends upon and limited time available for the project,
I can't also patch libraries in older versions of the app.

Please update to new versions whenever offered. If you're not offered the latest version above and your phone cannot
run a newer operating system than you have now, it might be impossible to get a long-term-secure version of the native app.
If this is the case, please consider using a web-based alternative to the app to stay safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email passwordmaker@webful.uk with "Security" in the subject line.

I'll reply as soon as I can with a plan, or requests for any more information if needed. As the app's a free side project,
I can't offer a bounty for disclosure â€“ but I really appreciate you choosing to disclose issues responsibly this way prior
to any wider publication.
