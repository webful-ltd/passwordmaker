[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/webful-ltd/passwordmaker.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/webful-ltd/passwordmaker)

A modern mobile app supporting [Password Maker](https://passwordmaker.org/).

Make secure, unique-per-site passwords.

Built with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## What's this?

This Android & iOS app makes you a unique password for each site you use, following a
deterministic algorithm which means no central trusted server, and compatibility with
several other plugins and apps which have followed the same conventions over the years.

See [the hype page](https://passwordmaker.webful.uk) for more about
what the app does, why you might want it and how to pick your [settings](https://passwordmaker.webful.uk/#settings).
